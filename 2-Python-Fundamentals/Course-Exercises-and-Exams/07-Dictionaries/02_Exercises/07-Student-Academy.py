# 7.	 Student Academy
# Write a program that keeps information about students and their grades.
# You will receive n pair of rows. First you will receive the student's name, after that you will receive his grade.
# Check if the student already exists and if not, add him. Keep track of all grades for each student.
# When you finish reading the data, keep the students with average grade higher than or equal to 4.50.
# Order the filtered students by average grade in descending order.
# Print the students and their average grade in the following format:
# {name} â€“> {averageGrade}
# Format the average grade to the 2nd decimal place.
