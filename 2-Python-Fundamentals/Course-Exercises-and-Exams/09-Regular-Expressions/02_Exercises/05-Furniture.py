# 5.	Furniture
# Write a program to calculate the total cost of different types of furniture.
# You will be given some lines of input until you receive the line "Purchase". For the line to be valid it should be in the following format:
# ">>{furniture name}<<{price}!{quantity}"
# The price can be floating point number or whole number. Store the names of the furniture and the total price.
# At the end print the each bought furniture on separate line in the format:
# "Bought furniture:
# {1st name}
# {2nd name}
# â€¦"
# And on the last line print the following: "Total money spend: {spend money}" formatted to the second decimal point.
