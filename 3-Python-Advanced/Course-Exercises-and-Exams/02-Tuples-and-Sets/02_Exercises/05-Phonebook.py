# 5.	Phonebook
# Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
# Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-".
# If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.
# After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N.
# Your program should be able to perform a search of a contact by name and print its details in format
# "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist."

# data = input()
#
# phonebook = {}
#
# while not data.isdigit():
#     name, phone_number = data.split('-')
#     phonebook[name] = phone_number
#
#     data = input()
#
# for _ in range(int(data)):
#     contact = input()
#
#     if phonebook.get(contact):
#         print(f"{contact} -> {phonebook[contact]}")
#     else:
#         print(f"Contact {contact} does not exist.")
