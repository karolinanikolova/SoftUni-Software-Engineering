# 7.	*Robotics
# Somewhere in the future, there is a robotics factory. The current project is assembly line robots.
# Each robot has a processing time â€“ it is the time in seconds the robot needs to process a product.
# When a robot is free it should take a product for processing and log his name, product and processing start time.
# Each robot processes a product coming from the assembly line. A product is coming from the line each second
# (so the first product should appear at [start time + 1 second]). If a product passes the line and there is not a
# free robot to take it, it should be queued at the end of the line again.
# The robots are standing on the line in the order of their appearance.
