# 6.	*Extract the Links
# Write a program that extracts links from a given text. The text will come in the form of strings, each representing a sentence.
# You need to extract only the valid links from it. Example:
#
# "www.internet.com"
#
# 				Sub-Domain									Domain name										Domain extension
#
# The Sub-Domain must always be "www". The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters (uppercase and lowercase),
# digits and dashes ("â€“"). The Domain extension consists of one or more domain blocks, a domain block consists of a dot
# followed by one or more lowercase English alphabet letters, a Domain extension must have at least one domain block in order to be valid.
# The Sub-Domain and Domain name must be separated by a single dot. Any link that does NOT follow the specified above rules should be treated as invalid.
