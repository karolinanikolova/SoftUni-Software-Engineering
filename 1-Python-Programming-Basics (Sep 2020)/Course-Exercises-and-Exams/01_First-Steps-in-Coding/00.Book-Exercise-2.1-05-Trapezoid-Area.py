# face of a trapezoid
# Write a program that reads from the console three numbers b1, b2 and h and calculates the face of a trapezoid with bases b1 and b2 and height h.
# The formula for a trapezoidal face is (b1 + b2) * h / 2 .

b1 = float(input())
b2 = float(input())
h = float(input())
print((b1 + b2)* h / 2)
