# 01.	 SoftUni Reception
# Every day thousands of students pass by the reception at SoftUni with different questions to ask and
# the employees have to help everyone by providing all the information and to answer all of the questions.
# There are 3 employees working on the reception all day. Each of them can handle different number of students per hour.
# Your task is to calculate how much time it will take to answer all the questions of given number of students.
# First you will receive 3 lines with integers, representing count of students that each of the employee can help per hour.
# On the next line you will receive students count as a single integer.
# Every forth hour all of the employees have a break, so they donâ€™t work for a hour. This is the only break for the employees,
# because they don`t need rest, nor have a personal life. Calculate the time needed to answer all the student's ' \
# questions and print it in the following format: "Time needed: {time}h."
