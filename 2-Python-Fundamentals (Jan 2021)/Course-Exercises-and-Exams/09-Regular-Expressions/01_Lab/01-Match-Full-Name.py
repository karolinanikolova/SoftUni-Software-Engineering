# o	After the first letter, it only contains lowercase letters afterwards.
# o	Each of the two words should be at least two letters long.

import re

pattern = r"\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b"

text = input()
valid_names = re.findall(pattern, text)
print(" ".join(valid_names))

# names = input().split(", ")
#
# valid_names = []
#
# for name in names:
#     match = re.match(pattern, name)
#     if match:
#
# print(" ".join(valid_names))
