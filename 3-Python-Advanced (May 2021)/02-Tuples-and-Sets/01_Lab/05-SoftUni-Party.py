# 5.	SoftUni Party
# There is a party at SoftUni. Many guests are invited and there are two types of them: Regular and VIP.
# When a guest comes, check if he/she exists in any of the two reservation lists.
# All reservation codes are 8 characters long and all VIP numbers will start with a digit.
# On the first line you will receive the number of guests â€“ N. On the next N lines you will be receiving
# their reservation codes. After that, you will be receiving guests, who came to the party, until you read
# the "END" command.
# In the end, print the number of the guests who did not come to the party and their reservation numbers.
# The VIP guests must be first.
# Both the VIP and the Regular guests must be sorted in ascending order.
