# 5. Truck Tour
# On a circle road there are N petrol pumps. Petrol pumps are numbered 0 to (Nâˆ’1) (both inclusive).
# For each petrol pump you will receive two pieces of information:
# -	the amount of petrol that petrol pump will give
# -	the distance from that petrol pump to the next petrol pump (kilometers)
# Initially, you have a tank of infinite capacity carrying no petrol. You can start the tour at any of the petrol pumps.
# Calculate the first point from where the truck will be able to complete the circle. Consider that the truck will stop
# at each of the petrol pumps. The truck will move one kilometer for each liter of the petrol.
